Your function should recognize letters in both cases, i.e. "qwertyuiopASDFGHJKLzxcvbnm" is a valid alphabet.

longest_unique_subarray

Given an input list of integers arr,
return a list with two values [a,b] such that arr[a:a+b] is the longest unique subarray.
That is to say, all the elements of arr[a:a+b] must be unique,
and b must be the largest value possible for the array.
If multiple such subarrays exist (i.e. same b, different a), use the lowest value of a.

Example:
	Argument:
		[1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 6]
	Return:
		[1, 6]

string_my_one_true_love

A former(?) CA for this course really like[d] strings that have the same occurrences of letters.
This means the staff member likes "aabbcc", "ccddee", "abcabcabc", etcetera.

But the person who wrote all of your homework sets wants to trick the staff with really long strings,
that either could be the type of string that the staff member likes,
or a string that the CA would like if you remove exactly one character from the string.

Return True if it's a string that the homework creator made, and False otherwise.
Don't treat any characters specially, i.e. 'a' and 'A' are different characters.

Ungraded food for thought:
Ideally, your method should also work on integer arrays without any modification.

Example 1:
	Argument:
		"abcbabcdcdda"
		There are 3 a's, 3 b's, 3 c's, and 3 d's. That means it is a very likable string!
	Return:
		True

Example 2:
	Argument:
		"aaabbbcccddde"
		There are 3 a's, 3 b's, 3 c's, and 3 d's. We have 1 e, which we can remove.
	Return:
		True

Example 3:
	Argument:
		"aaabbbcccdddeeffgg"
		This string is similar to the other ones, except with 2 e's, f's and g's at the end.
		To make this string likable, we need to remove the 2 e's, f's, and g's or we can remove
		one a, b, c, and d. However all of these require more than one removal, so it becomes invalid.
	Return:
		False

alive_people

You are given a 2-dimensional list data. Each element in data is a list [birth_year, age_of_death].
Assume that the person was alive in the year (birth_year + age_of_death).
Given that data, return the year where the most people represented in the list were alive.
If there are multiple such years, return the earliest year.

three_sum

Given an input list of integers arr, and a constant target t,

Return a 2-dimensional list of all the unique triplets as defined above.
Each inner list should be a triplet as we defined above.

zero_sum_subarray

Given an input list of integers arr,
return a list with two values [a,b] such that sum(arr[a:a+b]) == 0.
In plain English, give us the location of a subarray of arr that starts at index a
and continues for b elements, so that the sum of the subarray you indicated is zero.
If multiple such subarrays exist, use the lowest valid a, and then lowest valid b,
in that order of priority.
If no such subarray exists, return None.

Ungraded food for thought:
Think about how to generalize your solution to any arbitrary target sum.

Example 1:
	Argument:
		[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
		Clearly, the first element by itself forms a subarray with sum == 0.
	Return:
		[0, 1]

Example 2:
	Argument:
		[10, 20, -20, 3, 21, 2, -6]
		In this case, arr[1:3] = [20, -20], so there is a zero sum subarray.

		[1, 2]
